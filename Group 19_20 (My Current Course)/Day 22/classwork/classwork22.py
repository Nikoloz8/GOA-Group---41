#for loop:

# 1) Write a program that calculates and prints the sum of numbers from 1 to 10 using a for loop.

sum = 0
for i in range(1, 11):
    sum = sum + i
print(sum) 

# 2)Print the squares of numbers from 1 to 15.

for i in range(1, 16):
    i = i ** 2
    print(i)

# 3)Write a program that calculates and prints the sum of squares of numbers from 1 to 5 using a for loop.

sum = 0
for i in range(1, 6):
    sum = sum + i ** 2
print(sum)
