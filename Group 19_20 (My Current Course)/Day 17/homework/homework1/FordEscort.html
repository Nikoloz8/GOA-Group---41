        <p>The North American version of the Ford Escort is a range of cars that were sold by Ford from the 1981 to 2003 model years.
             The direct successor of the Ford Pinto, the Escort also largely overtook the role of the European-imported Ford Fiesta
              as the smallest vehicle in the Ford model line in North America. Produced across three generations, the first generation was a subcompact;
               the latter two generations were compact cars. Becoming highly successful in the marketplace, 
            the Escort became the best-selling car in the United States after 1982, a position it would hold for much of the 1980s.</p>
            <p>Produced across three generations, the Escort was the first world car developed by Ford, with the first-generation
                 American Escort designed alongside Ford of Europe, who transitioned the Escort Mk III to front-wheel drive. During its production,
                  the Escort also underwent a wide use of platform sharing and rebranding. The first generation served as the basis of the longer-wheelbase
                   Ford Tempo/Mercury Topaz, the two-seat Ford EXP/Mercury LN7 and was rebranded as the Mercury Lynx. The second generation was introduced 
                   for 1991, growing into the compact segment. Moving away from a shared design with Ford of Europe, the Escort now shared a platform with
                    the Mazda 323 and sharing a body with the Ford Laser (a model line sold in Asia and Oceania); the Mercury Lynx was replaced by the 
                    Mercury Tracer. For 1997, the third generation served as an extensive redesign of the previous-generation sedan; 
                the Escort ZX2 two-door was introduced, with the Mercury Tracer adopting a similar redesign.</p>
                <p>Ford introduced the Ford Focus in North America for 2000 as its third "world car", phasing it in as the successor of the Escort. After 2000,
                     the four-door Escort was moved primarily to fleet sales (with the coupe remaining available); 
                     production ended entirely after the 2002 model year.
                      In contrast to the first-generation American Escort and Escort Mk III of Ford of Europe 
                      (and the Mondeo/Contour and Mercury Mystique), the Focus adopted a much larger degree of commonality between its 
                      European and North American variants, in effect, becoming the original world car Ford had originally envisioned with the Escort.</p>

                      <p>During its entire production, the Escort was produced by Wayne Stamping & Assembly in (Wayne, Michigan)
                         and the first generation was also produced by Edison Assembly in (Edison, New Jersey), San Jose Assembly Plant in 
                         (Milpitas, California), and Oakville Assembly in (Oakville, Ontario, Canada) 
                        while the second and third generations were also produced by Hermosillo Stamping and Assembly in (Hermosillo, Sonora, Mexico).</p>
